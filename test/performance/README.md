# Performance Debug Tools

This directory contains debugging and analysis tools used during the performance optimization sprint.

## Files

- **`debug-ast.js`** - Debug AST structure for conditional templates
- **`deep-profile.js`** - Deep profiling analysis for bottleneck identification
- **`extreme-analysis.js`** - Extreme performance analysis and optimization detection
- **`gold-medal-analysis.js`** - Gold medal level optimization analysis and pattern detection
- **`profile-bottlenecks.js`** - Performance bottleneck profiling and measurement

## Usage

Run any file from the project root:

```bash
# Debug AST structure
node test/performance/debug-ast.js

# Profile performance bottlenecks
node test/performance/profile-bottlenecks.js

# Deep performance analysis
node test/performance/deep-profile.js
```

These tools were instrumental in achieving the championship-level performance optimizations in Jempl's rendering engine.
